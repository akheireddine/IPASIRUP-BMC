the following signals can be temporarily removed:

new formula: G(i1->(o1 | !o2)) & G(!i1->(o3 | !o4)) & G(i2->(!o1 | o2)) & G(!i2->(!o3 | o4))
there are 2 subformulas
working on subformula G(i1->(o1 | !o2)) & G(i2->(!o1 | o2))
trying to create strategy directly for G(i1->(o1 | !o2)) & G(i2->(!o1 | o2))
direct strategy was found.
direct strat has 1 states, 1 edges and 0 colors
