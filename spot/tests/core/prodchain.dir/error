autfilt: Too many acceptance sets used.  The limit is 32.

If you do not mind a slowdown, you could try recompiling Spot with a larger limit.
See the --enable-max-accsets=N configure option.

If you believe Spot could be improved to solve your problem
using the current limit, please email <spot@lrde.epita.fr>.
